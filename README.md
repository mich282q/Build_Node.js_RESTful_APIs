# To see if it is install:

Kindly run npm -v and mongo --version as these will show you the version of NPM and MongoDB installed on your machine.


# how to get it to work

Create a package.json file

- npm init

Let's install express and nodmon, express will be used to create the server while nodmon will help us to 
keep track of changes to our application by watching changed files and automatically restart the server.

- npm install --save-dev nodemon

- npm install express --save

Firsr of all, letâ€™s install mongoose 

- npm install mongoose --save

On successful installation, your package.json file will be modified to have the two newly installed packages.
